This study provides a case study for a vertical indoor farm based on recent developments and components.
I aim to provide a rough, basic calculation for a minimal setup and feasibility as well as outlining potential options for a setup.
I do **not** include any further IT automation setup, as well as **not** including Operational Expenses (Labour, Rent). Only potential revenues and CAPEX to calculate the Break-Even. \
This is just a rough estimation and as well does not goes deeper into e.g. comparison of hydroponics, aeroponics, aquaponics and their detailed impact on the capital expenses as well as operation expenses.

# Introduction

A few years back I fall over a small interview of Kimbal Musk and his platform https://www.squarerootsgrow.com/ for vertical farming. They basically started to grow food inside a shipping container. Since then I was hooked with the idea to have an complete self-sufficient environment which is able to deliver food (fast ohne Zutun weiterer Resourcen).
If energy is completely generated renewable (e.g. through Solar on the roof) and the water consumption is quite low due to cirulation this could be an enormous advantage to traditional agriculture. \
The only problem since ever is electricity consumption. Vertical Farming is growing but energy consumption is still a major threat even without consideration of heavy IT setups for automation to make this system fully autonomous.
I started growing parts of my own food some years back and still ambitious on testing new ways of growing, lights, kompost, watering methods and so. So I am still keen to follow this approach and try to keep up with new developments by any chance.
However, I never did any calculation (nor found any) on a proper evaluation of an autonomous growing system e.g. based in such a container.

So I thought it`s time to do it.

As the increasing demand for sustainable food production has driven innovation in vertical indoor farming to optimize space and resource usage while reducing environmental impact the economic feasibility of these systems remains a key challenge, particularly when relying on renewable energy sources. This study therefore tries to examine the viability of a minimal vertical farm setup integrating hydroponics, solar panels, and artificial lights.

I outline an approach to estimate energy consumption, crop yield, and overall financial feasibility. By analyzing recent advancements in solar panel efficiency, LED grow light technology, and hydroponic farming methods, we develop a baseline calculation for an entry-level system. Our study quantifies the number of solar panels required, the crop cycles achievable per year, and the expected revenue generation, considering real-world constraints such as energy efficiency, space limitations, and capital costs. However we do not include further operational costs in this study due to its variable factors.

The findings provide a first-step assessment evaluating vertical farms. Additionally, we explore potential avenues for margin improvements, highlighting opportunities for technological optimization, energy integration, and system scalability.

# Considerations of Hydroponic Systems for Vertical Farming

To provide some background information on the topic - Hydroponics is a soilless cultivation method to enable efficient plant growth by delivering nutrients directly to the roots through a water-based solution. This approach is particularly well-suited for vertical farming due to its space efficiency, controlled nutrient delivery, and reduced water consumption.

Overall, hydroponic systems offer several key benefits:

* **Water Efficiency:** Hydroponics uses up to 90 percent less water[^1] compared to traditional soil-based farming, as the nutrient solution is recirculated within a closed system.
* **Higher Yield per Square Meter:** By optimizing nutrient delivery and removing soil-related growth constraints, hydroponic farming can achieve higher crop densities and shorter growth cycles.
* **Automation Potential:** Sensors and automated dosing systems enable precise control over pH, nutrient concentration, and water levels, diseases, reducing manual intervention and improving consistency.
* **Reduced Land and Resource Use:** Without the need for large land areas, hydroponic farms can be implemented in urban environments, repurposed buildings, or shipping containers, minimizing the footprint while maximizing output.

There are systems like Auquaponics and Aeroponics - however for the following case chosing the system will not have such a large impact as main is energy consumption for the light and pump has only small impact on the overall system.[^2]

# Calculations

First of all we want to calculate - if we have an environment like a shipping container - which has a fixed roof size - how many panels would we be able to install, how many systems could we power with this setup - and how much revenues would we get from this growing salad as one of the profitable and efficient growing crops.
For comparison purposes we will do further calculations with a standardized sizing based on current Shipping Containers due to scalability purposes and generalisation options.

To do our calculations we will take the following panel for energy generation in our hypothetical setup.

One of the efficient Solar Panels I could find the specifications are:

* Tiger Neo N-type 54HL4R-B[^3]
* Yield: 425-445 Watt
* Dimension: 1762 x 1143 mm

For a standard 20-foot shipping container, the roof dimensions are:

* Width: 2.23 m (7.3 ft)
* Length: 5.44 m (17.8 ft)

First of all let`s calculate the area of the solar panel and the container roof

$$ \text{Area of 1 Panel} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 1.762\text{m} \times 1.143\text{m} = 2.01\text{m}^2 $$

$$ \text{Area of roof} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2.23\text{m} \times 5.44\text{m} = 12.11\text{m}^2 $$

Now we can determine how many solar panels can actually fit on the roof. Assuming the panels are aligned with their long side along the length of the roof and their shorter side along the width:

**Number of Panels Along the Length**


THis we need to refine here......
$$
\text{Panels along length} = \frac{\text{Length of roof}}{\text{Length of panel}} = \frac{5.44}{1.143} \approx 4.76
$$


As we can work with overlaps and for simplicity we calculate with a number of 5 panels per container roof.

As from our product specifications one solar panel will yield about 435 W. Assuming a 5 peak sun hours this will yield 

$$ \text{1740 Wh/day} \times 365 = 635 \text{kWh/year}  $$

Calculated with an available space of 5 Solar Panels this will therefore give us total energy of $$ \text{3175 kWh/year} $$

Now - based on our calculations we can calculate the amount of energy required we can use each day based on an annual available energy of 3175 kWh, therefore let`s divide the total available energy by the number of days in a year (365 days): 

$$ \text{Energy per day} = \frac{3175 \, \mathrm{kWh}}{365 \, \mathrm{days}} \approx 8.7 \, \mathrm{kWh/day} $$

This will give us an available amount of energy  $$ \\approx 8.7 \, \mathrm{kWh/day}\ $$

# Maxing out the space

To improve scalability and margins of our system we need to consider maxing out the given space inside the container to stack as much systems inside as possible.
Therefore we assume a maximum amount of growing space per square meters to keep the farm fully self sufficient.

Assumung the 20ft container has 6m length x 2,5m height x 2,35 width and we stack several 1m2 systems we could potentially max this out to: 

$$ \text{5.898} \, \mathrm{m} \times 2.438 \, \mathrm{m} \approx 14.4 \, \mathrm{m}^2 \times 3 \, \text{layers} = \text{43,2}\mathrm{m}^2 $$

So this will give us an overall available space of **43,2m2** to grow.
The current calculation is hypothetic. If we calculate more conservative - we have 6 meters length (about 6 grow panels 1x1 meter) stacked in 3 layers on the left and right side each. This would end up in 6 x 3 x 2 = 36 m2.
On the other side there might be potential to max this out by stacking 4 or even 5 layers which would end up in 48 or 60 square meters respectively.
It is important to keep in mind that the more available growing space we have, it will have impact on the available Watt per square meter, so it will reduce the available watt per square meter, but on the other hand increase revenues but also can potentially have impact on the crop yield due to the lightning system.

# Energy Consumption Requirements

To do our further calculations we will work with the following assumptions:

* To efficiently grow our produce - lights need to shine 18hrs per day.
* The water pump needs to run approximatly 2 hours per day but has only slight impact on our overall calculation therefore it will be dismissed in the following calculations.

Given the fact that we have 
* **43 square meters** of growing space and 
* **8,7 kWh** available Energy per day

First we calculate how much energy is available per square meter by dividing the total available energy by the number of square meters:

$$ \text{Energy per square meter per day} = \frac{8.7 \, \text{kWh}}{43 \, \text{m}^2} \approx 0.202 \, \text{kWh/m}^2 
$$
After, we calculate the maximum wattage per square meter. Since we are operating for 18 hours a day, the formula for wattage per square meter is:

$$
\text{Wattage per square meter} = \frac{0.202 \, \text{kWh/m}^2}{18 \, \text{hours}} \times 1000 \approx 11.22 \, \text{W/m}^2
$$

Which results in the maximum wattage per square meter we can use for our components is approximately 11.22 W/m².
With a calculation of 36 m2 meters we will end up about **13 W/m²**. So there is no big difference for available Watt per square meter.
But the overall calculation is important to carefully chose the lightning system which has the ability to shine on 1 square meter with the calculated amount of Watt.
There are few solutions but we have to keep in mind that the low Watt has impact on overall ability to grow the plants. Therefore it is highly recommended to evaluate the potential lightning systems and do further tests before scaling. 

# Calculation of potential Crop Yields

For the calculation of potential crop yields we will first start to calculate with the following assumptions:

* **Growing Area:** 43 square meter (m²).
* **Crop Cycle Duration:** The duration of each indoor salad crop cycle is assumed to be 30 days.
* **Yield per Crop Cycle:** The yield for indoor-grown lettuce (salad) per square meter per crop cycle is assumed to be 2 kg.
* **Revenue per kg:** The sale price of indoor-grown lettuce is assumed to be €6 per kg.
* **Plants per Square Meter:** Based on a dense growing setup, approximately 10-12 lettuce plants can be grown per square meter.

Even though the yield of each plant varies, but typically, a well-grown lettuce plant can produce around 200 grams of usable edible leaves (depending on the variety). 
In the following calculation we will therefore assume that each plant yields around 200 grams per cycle, and with the assumed 12 plants per square meter, the total yield per cycle from 1 square meter would be:

$$ \text{Total yield per crop cycle (kg)} = 12 \, \text{plants} \times 0.2 \, \mathrm{kg/plant} = 2.4 \, \mathrm{kg} $$

This gives a maximum of 2.4 kg of lettuce per crop cycle from 1 square meter.
However, due to variances in growing conditions, plant health, and growth rates, we are going to assume a more conservative estimate of 2 kg per square meter to account for these factors.

With 365 days per year, and crop cycle length of around 30 days, we calculate the number of crop cycles per year as:

$$ \text{Number of crop cycles} = \frac{365}{30} \approx 12.17 \ \text{cycles/year} $$

As well - For practical purposes, we round this down to 12 full cycles.

Now the total crop yield per year is the yield per cycle multiplied by the number of cycles per year:

$$ \text{Total yield per year} = 2 \, \mathrm{kg} \times 12 \, \text{cycles} = 24 \ \mathrm{kg/year} $$

Therefore, the total crop yield per year is 24 kg per square meter.
Multiplied with the available 43 square meters we end up with **a total amount of 1032kg**.

If we go with a conservative assumption of each kg of salad is sold for €5, we calculate the total revenue per year as:

$$ \text{Revenue per year} = 864 \, \mathrm{kg} \times 5 \, \mathrm{€/kg} = 5160 \, \mathrm{€} $$

Therefore, the total potential revenue per year would be **€5160 per container**.
